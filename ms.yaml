# Base default settings for ms format, primarily intended for
# PDF production
#
# NOTE: instead of `--toc`, add `-d ms-toc` and perhaps also `-d ms-coverpage`
#
# NOTE on fonts:
#   - For font combos, add `-d ms-font-XY` where XY is a short mnemomic.
#   - Font families that come with groff:
#     - Serifs: BM (ITC Bookman Light), N (New Century Schoolbook), P (Palatino),
#       T (Times), U-BM (URW Bookman L Light), U-N (Century Schoolbook L),
#       U-P (URW Palladio L), U-T (Nimbus Roman No9)
#     - Sans-serifs: A (ITC Avant Garde Gothic Book), H (Helvetica), HN
#       (Helvetica Narrow), U-A (URW Gothic L), U-HN (Nimbus Sans L Condensed)
#     - Monospaced: C (Courier), which in my setup has been overridden by
#       New Computer Modern Mono; and U-C (Nimbus Mono L).
#   - Font families that I have installed for groff:
#     - Serifs: Aleg (Alegreya), FSer (FreeSerif), GarLib (Garamond Libre), Lib
#       (Libertinus), Minion (Minion Pro), NewCM (New Computer Modern),
#       ScrSer (Source Serif 4), Crim (Crimson Pro), Lora, EBGar (EB Garamond).
#     - Sans-serifs (e.g. for heading-fontfam): NewCMSans (New Computer Modern
#       Sans), Myriad (Myriad Pro), FiraGo, SrcSans (Source Sans 3)
#     - Monospaced: New Computer Modern Mono as "C".
